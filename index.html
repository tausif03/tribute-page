				<p>Here's a timeline of Dennis Ritchie's life:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="dates">Sep 9, 1941</span> - Born in Bronxville NY.</li>
					<li><span class="dates">Jan 1, 1967</span> - Ritchie started working at Bell Labs. Here is where he worked on Multics operating system.</li>
					<li><span class="dates">May 1, 1968</span> - Ritchie earned his bachelor's degree in Physics in 1963, and completed his Doctorate degree in Mathematics in 1968 from Harvard University.</li>
					<li><span class="dates">Jan 1, 1969</span> - Bell Labs dropped the Multics operating systems project in 1969. This prompted Ritchie to develop C programming language and, with Thompson, create the UNIX operating system.</li>
					<li><span class="dates">Nov 3, 1971</span> - Unix was released on November 3rd, 1971, opening a operating system to work on a variety of platforms with highly adapted quality.</li>
					<li><span class="dates">Jan 1, 1972</span> - Ritchie and Thompson's operating system was not functioning on the more advanced PDP-11 mini computer in 1971. This prompted Ritchie to create C programming lanuage. C programming lanuage is very popular and important to the development of software including programs such as C++ and Java.</li>
					<li><span class="dates">Jan 1, 1973</span> - Ritchie and Thompson wrote UNIX using C programming language. This allowed for UNIX to work a wide variety of computers in a range of large and minicomputers and advanced to simple computers.</li>
					<li><span class="dates">Jan 1, 1983</span> - A.M Turing Award  owinner (with Ken Thompson) of the A.M. Turing Award. It is a prestigious award and the top achievement in Computer Science. They recieved this award for, "their development of generic operating systems theory and specifically for the implementation of the UNIX operating system" (Hosch).</li>
					<li><span class="dates">Jan 1, 1988</span> - Ritchie was elected into the U.S National Academy of Engineering in 1988.</li>
					<li><span class="dates">Jan 1, 1990</span> - Ritchie was appointed the head of the System Software Research Department at Bell Labs in 1990.</li>
					<li><span class="dates">Jan 1, 1994</span> - Computer Pioneer Award  Awarded the 1994 Computer Pioneer Award, "In recognition of contribution to the development of Unix" (Dennis).</li>
					<li><span class="dates">Apr 21, 1999</span> - Richie and Thompson are awarded the U.S. National Medal of Technology Award from President Bill Clinton for inventing UNIX and C programming language.</li>
					<li><span class="dates">Oct 12, 2011</span> - Died at the age of 70 in Berkeley Heights, NJ.</li>
